# GitUser-Finder
This was an API project I made. A simple search app to find GitHub users and repos by username. Oauth app registered with the GitHub API

Here I used a bootswatch template for styling and ES6 standards like classes, async. & await, fetch, and arrow functions for more condensed and tidy code
